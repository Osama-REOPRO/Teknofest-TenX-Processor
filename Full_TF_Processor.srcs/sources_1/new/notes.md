# To-do
- [x] make the core start at address 0x80000000
- [x] the cache controller is never done, why?
- [x] why aren't we getting read data?
- [x] read data is switching to 0 before it is read, why?
    - problem is in conflict resolver
---- it finally works!!!!
- [x] first instruction read correctly, second one read semi-correctly, why?
---- fetch cycle works correctly
- [x] cach never hits, even though it has the data, why?
    - never asserting set valid
- [x] read_needed_cache is behaving wrong and we are never entering cache read mode, instead we go writing instead!
    - we never get a read_op
---- cache functional
- [x] cache problem: done getting raised afterwards
    - problem I think is that the delayed operations that raise it are getting called multiple times
- [ ] cache written wrong value
    - I think when it doesn't hit it is following an older logic and writing from read data from main, but this is a write not a read, in this case we should write data combined between what we read and what we are writing
